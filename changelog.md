# Weekly ETF OS — Changelog

This file records meaningful codebase, workflow, rendering, state-contract, pricing, and delivery changes for `market-predictions/weekly-etf`.

## 2026-05-24 — Add ETF pricing-lineage contract and central pricing changelog

### What changed
- Added `control/ETF_PRICING_LINEAGE_CONTRACT_V1.md` as the authority for the next pricing hardening cycle.
- Added `control/ETF_PRICING_LINEAGE_CHANGELOG.md` as the central detailed changelog for pricing-lineage changes and regressions.
- Updated `control/SYSTEM_INDEX.md` to register the new pricing-lineage control files and the intended `output/run_manifests/` location.
- Updated `control/CURRENT_STATE.md` to mark pricing lineage as the active engineering priority and to clarify that visible close-price disclosure is not sufficient proof that the fresh-pricing issue is solved.
- Updated `control/NEXT_ACTIONS.md` with a dedicated Phase 1B for immutable audit identity, exact manifest linkage, price-row schema/status upgrades, state persistence, challenger pricing tiers, and a hard pricing-lineage validator.

### Why
The latest investigation showed that the report can display fresh closes and reconcile internally while still lacking a deterministic proof chain from immutable pricing audit to runtime state, report tables, persisted portfolio state, valuation history, and delivery manifest. The new contract prevents another round of surface-level patches and defines the implementation target before production pricing code is changed.

### Affected files
- `control/ETF_PRICING_LINEAGE_CONTRACT_V1.md`
- `control/ETF_PRICING_LINEAGE_CHANGELOG.md`
- `control/SYSTEM_INDEX.md`
- `control/CURRENT_STATE.md`
- `control/NEXT_ACTIONS.md`
- `changelog.md`

### Validation / evidence
- No runtime pricing code changed in this entry. This is a control/design-layer commit. Next validation is implementation of the contract and the future `tools/validate_etf_pricing_lineage_contract.py` gate.

## 2026-05-24 — Render ETF close disclosure from pricing audit, not portfolio state

### What changed
- Updated `runtime/add_etf_pricing_basis_section.py` so the close-price disclosure table is built from the latest `output/pricing/price_audit_*.json` rather than from the simplified portfolio-state position fields.
- The disclosure now shows requested close date, actual close date used, close price, currency, client-facing market-data source, and status.
- Internal resolver labels such as `issuer_override`, `source_detail`, and `handler` are no longer rendered client-facing.
- Removed visible HTML comment markers from the markdown/PDF output.
- Updated `tools/validate_etf_pricing_basis_disclosure.py` so it validates the heading/table itself instead of relying on hidden marker comments, and fails if internal pricing labels leak into the client report.

### Why
The previous disclosure made the pricing basis visible but was still not client-grade. It exposed implementation markers and showed `issuer_override` as the source, even when the audit showed delegated market data such as Yahoo history. The report must show the real audit-derived pricing basis in readable language, not internal plumbing labels.

### Affected files
- `runtime/add_etf_pricing_basis_section.py`
- `tools/validate_etf_pricing_basis_disclosure.py`
- `changelog.md`

### Validation / evidence
- User review showed visible `ETF_PRICE_BASIS_DISCLOSURE_*` markers and `issuer_override` in the delivered report. Next validation step is a fresh ETF production run.

## 2026-05-24 — Prioritize live API close discovery before issuer override

### What changed
- Updated `pricing/source_registry.yaml` so ETF holdings try `twelve_data`, `fmp`, `alpha_vantage`, and `yahoo_history` before `issuer_override`.
- Updated `pricing/clients/issuer_override.py` to describe itself as a last-resort issuer hook and record delegated Yahoo history explicitly in `source_detail` and metadata.

### Why
The report made clear that all current holding prices were coming from `issuer_override`. That was not the intended layered close-discovery behavior. The old source order let `issuer_override` short-circuit the normal API cascade, and the override implementation internally delegated to Yahoo while relabeling the result as `issuer_override`. The new order restores the expected API-first discovery path and keeps issuer override only as a final operational fallback.

### Affected files
- `pricing/source_registry.yaml`
- `pricing/clients/issuer_override.py`
- `changelog.md`

### Validation / evidence
- Previous report showed all six holdings with pricing source `issuer_override`. Next validation step is a fresh ETF production run; the disclosure table should show live/API sources where available, with `issuer_override:...:delegated_yahoo_history` only if all normal sources fail.

## 2026-05-24 — Treat DBC as optional RS duel proxy

### What changed
- Updated `tools/validate_replacement_duel_rs_coverage.py` so `DBC` is no longer a hard-required GLD challenger for the 1m/3m relative-strength gate.
- `GSG` remains the required broad-commodity challenger and `BIL` remains the required cash-like ballast challenger for GLD.
- `DBC` remains configured in the replacement-duel target map and can still be used when relative-strength data is available.

### Why
A fresh production run failed before report rendering because `DBC` lacked 1m/3m yfinance return data. That should not block the entire ETF production run when the required GLD replacement-duel coverage is still available through `GSG` and `BIL`. This keeps the RS quality gate intact for strategic required duels while treating source-fragile secondary proxies as optional.

### Affected files
- `tools/validate_replacement_duel_rs_coverage.py`
- `changelog.md`

### Validation / evidence
- Previous workflow failure: `Replacement duel RS coverage failed: required strategic tickers lack 1m/3m returns: DBC`. Next validation step is a fresh ETF production run.

## 2026-05-24 — Keep valuation history as first Section 7 table

### What changed
- Updated `runtime/add_etf_pricing_basis_section.py` so the explicit closing-price disclosure is inserted after the Section 7 valuation-history table rather than before it.

### Why
The equity-curve parser and validator intentionally treat the first table in Section 7 as the portfolio valuation history. Placing the new pricing-basis table before that table caused the validator to parse the wrong table and report `Section 7 has only 0 point(s)`. The disclosure remains visible in Section 7, but no longer breaks the existing equity-curve contract.

### Affected files
- `runtime/add_etf_pricing_basis_section.py`
- `changelog.md`

### Validation / evidence
- Previous workflow failure: `ETF equity curve history validation failed ... Section 7 has only 0 point(s); expected at least 3.` Next validation step is a fresh ETF production run.

## 2026-05-24 — Fix pricing-basis disclosure validator after ticker linkification

### What changed
- Updated `tools/validate_etf_pricing_basis_disclosure.py` so it normalizes TradingView markdown links back to plain ticker symbols before checking whether each holding row is present.

### Why
The pricing-basis disclosure was inserted before the ticker-linkification step. By validation time, cells such as `SPY` had become `[SPY](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=SPY)`. The validator still looked only for raw `| SPY |` table cells, causing a false failure that looked like missing prices even though the pricing pass itself had completed.

### Affected files
- `tools/validate_etf_pricing_basis_disclosure.py`
- `changelog.md`

### Validation / evidence
- Previous workflow failure: `missing pricing row for PAVE, SMH, PPA, SPY, URNM, GLD` in both EN/NL reports after ticker-linkification. Next validation step is a fresh ETF production run.

---

## 2026-05-23 — Add explicit closing-price disclosure to ETF report

### What changed
- Added `runtime/add_etf_pricing_basis_section.py` to inject an explicit EN/NL Section 7 disclosure table showing each holding's close date used, close price used, currency, pricing source, and pricing status.
- Added `tools/validate_etf_pricing_basis_disclosure.py` to fail the workflow if the latest EN/NL reports do not show per-holding close-price basis and EUR/USD FX basis.
- Updated `.github/workflows/send-weekly-report.yml` so the pricing-basis disclosure is inserted before polish/localization/linkification and validated before delivery.

### Why
The latest report showed the portfolio valuation date and equity curve, but it was still not clear which actual closing prices were used for each ETF holding. The report should make the pricing basis audit visible to the reader, not only persist it in `output/pricing/`.

### Affected files
- `runtime/add_etf_pricing_basis_section.py`
- `tools/validate_etf_pricing_basis_disclosure.py`
- `.github/workflows/send-weekly-report.yml`
- `changelog.md`

### Validation / evidence
- Next validation step is a fresh ETF production run. The report should include `Closing prices used in this report` / `Gebruikte slotkoersen in dit rapport` in Section 7.

## 2026-05-21 — Use earlier ETF close availability cutoff

### What changed
- Updated `pricing/run_pricing_pass.py` so `US_CLOSE_AVAILABLE_UTC` is now `20:45` instead of `22:30`.

### Why
A fresh ETF run after the regular U.S. cash close still selected the previous trading day because the close-date resolver waited until 22:30 UTC. The new 20:45 UTC cutoff lets evening-Europe runs use the just-completed U.S. close while still leaving a buffer after the regular market close.

### Affected files
- `pricing/run_pricing_pass.py`
- `changelog.md`

### Validation / evidence
- Next validation step is a fresh ETF production run. It should request the latest completed close rather than falling back to the previous trading day when run after 20:45 UTC.
